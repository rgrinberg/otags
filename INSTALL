                             INSTALLATION
===========================================================================

1- optional: If you want to run the regression test after compilation
   you need sexplib and its dependency type-conv (Debian packages
   libsexplib-camlp4-dev and libtype-conv-camlp4-dev). If you only
   want to compile and use otags then don't install those packages.

2- configure with

   ./configure

   Recognized options are:
     --prefix <path>       installation prefix [/usr/local]
     --bindir <path>       user executables [PREFIX/bin]
     --mandir <path>       man pages [PREFIX/share/man]
     --bytecode            don't use native compiler (for testing only)
     --ocamllibdir <path>  ocaml library directory (for testing only)
     --no-version-check    don't check for correct ocaml version 
                                                       (not recommended)

   The first three options set the installation directories.

   The --no-version-check option disables the ocaml version check. Use 
   it at your own risk (for instance when your working with the latest 
   cvs version of ocaml).

   The option --ocamllibdir sets the directory in which
   type-conf/pa_type_conv.cma and sexplib/pa_sexp_conv.cma can be
   found if you have them installed and they cannot be found
   automatically using ocamlfind.

   [If you want to know the details: The configure script checks for
    ocamlc and ocamlopt.opt. When the latter is found native compilation
    is used. It further checks wheter all of ocamldep, camlp4, camlp4of,
    camlp4oof, camlp4orf, camlp4rf, camlp4rf, camlp4o and camlp4r are
    installed and have the same version as ocamlc and ocamlopt.opt. The
    location of the camlp4 executables is hardwired in the executable
    (via conf.ml.in). The script uses "ocamlfind query" to determine the
    location of sexplib and type_conv. 
   ]

3- compile with

   make all

4- acquire suitable rights and install

   make install


5- optional, if you want update-otags, check the path' in
   contrib/update-otags and contrib/Makefile and do then

   make -C contrib install
